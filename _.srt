1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
A few days later

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,480
Yes, hello?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,160
Yes, director.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,120
Oh, I'm Lim Junbin.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,840
Could you tell my father about it?

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
No, it's not anything else.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,120
As soon as I got into the company,

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:37,360
I don't want the staff to be behind me when I become the director.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,520
And I don't want to inherit the company.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,040
Please tell your father.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,720
No, if you tell your father, he'll understand.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,000
I beg you.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, yes.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,360
Hello?

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
Hello?

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,520
What's this all of a sudden?

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,080
Why isn't it working?

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,520
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,240
I'll try the speaker phone.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
Hello?

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,080
Hello?

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,160
It's not working all of a sudden.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,320
I just called.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,280
Why, why?

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
Where are you?

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,240
Oh, I'm just here. Why?

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
You didn't forget, did you?

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,480
I'm going to meet Kim Hee-yeon's daughter later.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Oh, I'm not going to go.

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm not going to go.

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,920
Hurry up and go to the Silla Hotel Lounge in 30 minutes.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,160
Can't you just go instead of me?

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,600
Why would I go instead of you?

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,400
I don't know why I have to go.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,760
Hey, don't you know how helpful Kim Hee-yeon is to my father's business?

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,320
My father is my father.

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm me.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,040
And I'm not interested in business.

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,640
And I just have someone I love.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
It's not up to you.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,520
Go and meet her in 30 minutes.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
Didn't you hear me?

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
Hurry up and find me and get married.

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
Didn't you hear me?

46
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,320
I'm with the person I love right now.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm with you right now.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,800
You don't have anyone you love all of a sudden.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,560
I have someone I love.

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,320
I don't want to get married because I don't want to.

52
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,200
That's what I know.

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
You're at the coffee shop you go to all the time, right?

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
No, it's not there. Don't think about coming.

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to go now.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Wait there.

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
Hang up the phone.

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,880
I'm going crazy.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,960
I think he's coming.

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Oh, my God.

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Why are you laughing so much?

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Why are you laughing so much?

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Why are you laughing so much?

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Did I look like a child who doesn't have a job?

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm a housewife's son.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm sorry, but...

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm crying.

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,880
What?

69
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,240
Did something bad happen?

70
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,440
Did someone die?

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
No.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Did you go to the funeral?

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,040
Why?

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,520
Hang up the phone.

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,520
I have to go see Sunwoo.

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Why?

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,520
You're lying to me that you have someone you love.

78
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,480
What's wrong with you?

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
I'm crying.

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,800
What's wrong with you?

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Did something get on my face?

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Where is it?

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
What?

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Where is it?

85
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Honey, do you want some more?

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Is it him?

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Is it him?

88
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Who is it?

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Who is it?

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Who is it?

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Is it him?

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Why can't you tell me?

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Is it a lie?

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
No.

95
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Don't lie to me. Let's go see Sunwoo.

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Why do you want to see Sunwoo?

97
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
It's really important to you.

98
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
I'm going to tell you everything.

99
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Don't lie to me.

100
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
What?

101
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
It's him.

102
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
What?

103
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
It's him.

104
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Why are you so vague?

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
It's him.

106
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
It's him.

107
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
It's him?

108
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Do you call your girlfriend?

109
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
It's him.

110
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
It's him?

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
His name is Lee.

112
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
What?

113
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It's him.

114
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
His name is Lee?

115
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
It's him.

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
It's him.

117
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
It's him?

118
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
What's his name?

119
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
What?

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
What?

121
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
You said you were his girlfriend.

122
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
What's his name?

123
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
It's him.

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
What?

125
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Why are you sitting separately?

126
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
What?

127
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I'm going to fart.

128
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
What?

129
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm going to fart and sit back down.

130
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm next to you.

131
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
I have a friend next to me.

132
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
friend?

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I'm here to introduce you to a friend.

134
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
I can't fart in here.

135
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
I have a bad stomach.

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I was going to fart.

137
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Don't lie to me.

138
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
What?

139
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Come out to get married next month.

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm here.

141
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
What?

142
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
I think you're uncomfortable right now.

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
What did you do?

144
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
What did you do?

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
We always play pranks.

146
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
What are you doing with your teeth?

147
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Sit down.

148
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Sit down.

149
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Sit down.

150
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
My girlfriend is shy.

151
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Sit down.

152
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
I'll sit down for a second.

153
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Why are you putting on makeup?

154
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Wait a minute.

155
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm so scared.

156
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
I'm always funny.

157
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
What's your name?

158
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Lee Boon

159
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Where are you from?

160
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
I'm from Orion.

161
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
We met while playing pranks.

162
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Are you two in love?

163
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm shy.

164
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
I can't say I love you.

165
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Are you two dating?

166
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Why are you laughing?

167
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Do I look handsome?

168
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
What's wrong with you?

169
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Why are you so far away?

170
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
You're praying.

171
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
What do you like about him?

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
He's handsome.

173
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I'll listen to you.

174
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
He's sexy.

175
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Do you have a phobia?

176
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
He told me he was sexy.

177
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
You like him.

178
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
You're far away.

179
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Thank you.

180
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
What do you like about him?

181
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
What do you like about him?

182
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
He's funny.

183
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
I like his face.

184
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
How long have you been dating?

185
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
10 years?

186
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Be quiet.

187
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
How long have you been dating?

188
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I don't know.

189
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
You can't speak well?

190
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
It's been a few years since I came to Korea.

191
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
I lived abroad.

192
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I lived in Uganda.

193
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Uganda?

194
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Don't ask me that.

195
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
I'm not good at Korean.

196
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
What's your job?

197
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm a lawyer.

198
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm a farmer.

199
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
You're a farmer?

200
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
You're a farmer in Uganda?

201
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm a lawyer.

202
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
You're a farmer in Uganda?

203
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Stop it.

204
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Get out of here.

205
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
What are you going to do?

206
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I'll talk to you.

207
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
What are you talking about?

208
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Tell your mom and dad to come here.

209
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
What did you just say?

210
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
What did you just say?

211
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
What did you just say?

212
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Tell your mom and dad to come here.

213
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
This is a Christian church.

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Tell your mom and dad to come here.

215
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Okay, get out of here.

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Can I sit down for a while?

217
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Why?

218
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
You're pretty.

219
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Do you like him a lot?

220
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Do you like him a lot?

221
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Do you like him a lot?

222
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Are you sure you're dating him?

223
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
How much do you like him?

224
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
As much as my head hurts.

225
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
As much as my head hurts.

226
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
As much as my head hurts.
