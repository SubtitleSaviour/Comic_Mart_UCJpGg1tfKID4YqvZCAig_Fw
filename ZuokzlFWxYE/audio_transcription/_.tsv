15080	22840	Could you tell my father about it?
22840	24840	No, it's not anything else.
24840	29120	As soon as I got into the company,
29120	37360	I don't want the staff to be behind me when I become the director.
37360	41520	And I don't want to inherit the company.
41520	45040	Please tell your father.
45040	48720	No, if you tell your father, he'll understand.

86120	89920	Hurry up and go to the Silla Hotel Lounge in 30 minutes.
89920	94160	Can't you just go instead of me?
94160	97600	Why would I go instead of you?
97600	100400	I don't know why I have to go.
100400	105760	Hey, don't you know how helpful Kim Hee-yeon is to my father's business?
105760	108320	My father is my father.
108320	109400	I'm me.
109400	112040	And I'm not interested in business.
112040	115640	And I just have someone I love.

119520	121120	Didn't you hear me?
121120	121920	Hurry up and find me and get married.
121920	123400	Didn't you hear me?
123400	125320	I'm with the person I love right now.
125320	127200	I'm with you right now.
127200	129800	You don't have anyone you love all of a sudden.
129800	131160	I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.
131160	132560	I have someone I love.
132560	134320	I don't want to get married because I don't want to.
134320	135200	That's what I know.
135200	137520	You're at the coffee shop you go to all the time, right?
137520	140800	No, it's not there. Don't think about coming.
140800	142000	I'm going to go now.
142000	144160	Wait there.
144160	145920	Hang up the phone.

169120	171120	Why are you laughing so much?
171120	173120	Why are you laughing so much?
173120	186080	Did I look like a child who doesn't have a job?
186080	191600	I'm a housewife's son.
191600	192800	I'm sorry, but...
192800	194160	I'm crying.
194160	196880	What?
196880	198240	Did something bad happen?
198240	199440	Did someone die?
199440	201680	No.
202240	204240	Did you go to the funeral?
204240	205040	Why?

207520	211520	I have to go see Sunwoo.
211520	215120	Why?
215120	217520	You're lying to me that you have someone you love.

250640	252640	Is it him?
252640	254640	Why can't you tell me?
254640	256640	Is it a lie?
256640	258640	No.
258640	260640	Don't lie to me. Let's go see Sunwoo.
260640	262640	Why do you want to see Sunwoo?
262640	264640	It's really important to you.
