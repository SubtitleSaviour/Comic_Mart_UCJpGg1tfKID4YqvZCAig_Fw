Yes, director.
Oh, I'm Lim Junbin.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Could you tell my father about it?
No, it's not anything else.
As soon as I got into the company,
I don't want the staff to be behind me when I become the director.
And I don't want to inherit the company.
Please tell your father.
No, if you tell your father, he'll understand.
I beg you.
