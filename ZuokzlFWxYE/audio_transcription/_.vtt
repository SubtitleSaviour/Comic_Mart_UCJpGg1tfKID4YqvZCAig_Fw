00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
A few days later

00:07.680 --> 00:09.480
Yes, hello?

00:09.480 --> 00:11.160
Yes, director.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.120
Oh, I'm Lim Junbin.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.080
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:15.080 --> 00:22.840
Could you tell my father about it?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.840
No, it's not anything else.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.120
As soon as I got into the company,

00:29.120 --> 00:37.360
I don't want the staff to be behind me when I become the director.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.520
And I don't want to inherit the company.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.040
Please tell your father.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.720
No, if you tell your father, he'll understand.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.000
I beg you.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes, yes.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.360
Hello?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.560
Hello?

01:02.560 --> 01:04.520
What's this all of a sudden?

01:04.520 --> 01:05.080
Why isn't it working?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.520
Wait a minute.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.240
I'll try the speaker phone.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.200
Hello?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.080
Hello?

01:10.080 --> 01:11.160
It's not working all of a sudden.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.320
I just called.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.280
Why, why?

01:13.280 --> 01:14.400
Where are you?

01:14.400 --> 01:16.240
Oh, I'm just here. Why?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
You didn't forget, did you?

01:17.240 --> 01:20.480
I'm going to meet Kim Hee-yeon's daughter later.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.120
Oh, I'm not going to go.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.120
I'm not going to go.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.920
Hurry up and go to the Silla Hotel Lounge in 30 minutes.

01:29.920 --> 01:34.160
Can't you just go instead of me?

01:34.160 --> 01:37.600
Why would I go instead of you?

01:37.600 --> 01:40.400
I don't know why I have to go.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.760
Hey, don't you know how helpful Kim Hee-yeon is to my father's business?

01:45.760 --> 01:48.320
My father is my father.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.400
I'm me.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.040
And I'm not interested in business.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.640
And I just have someone I love.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.560
It's not up to you.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.520
Go and meet her in 30 minutes.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.120
Didn't you hear me?

02:01.120 --> 02:01.920
Hurry up and find me and get married.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.400
Didn't you hear me?

02:03.400 --> 02:05.320
I'm with the person I love right now.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.200
I'm with you right now.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.800
You don't have anyone you love all of a sudden.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.160
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.560
I have someone I love.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.320
I don't want to get married because I don't want to.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.200
That's what I know.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.520
You're at the coffee shop you go to all the time, right?

02:17.520 --> 02:20.800
No, it's not there. Don't think about coming.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.000
I'm going to go now.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.160
Wait there.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.920
Hang up the phone.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.880
I'm going crazy.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.960
I think he's coming.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.920
Oh, my God.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.120
Why are you laughing so much?

02:49.120 --> 02:51.120
Why are you laughing so much?

02:51.120 --> 02:53.120
Why are you laughing so much?

02:53.120 --> 03:06.080
Did I look like a child who doesn't have a job?

03:06.080 --> 03:11.600
I'm a housewife's son.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.800
I'm sorry, but...

03:12.800 --> 03:14.160
I'm crying.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.880
What?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.240
Did something bad happen?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.440
Did someone die?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.680
No.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.240
Did you go to the funeral?

03:24.240 --> 03:25.040
Why?

03:25.040 --> 03:27.520
Hang up the phone.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.520
I have to go see Sunwoo.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.120
Why?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.520
You're lying to me that you have someone you love.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.480
What's wrong with you?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.480
I'm crying.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.800
What's wrong with you?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.800
Did something get on my face?

03:52.640 --> 03:54.640
Where is it?

03:54.640 --> 03:56.640
What?

03:56.640 --> 03:58.640
Where is it?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.640
Honey, do you want some more?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.640
Is it him?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.640
Is it him?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.640
Who is it?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.640
Who is it?

04:08.640 --> 04:10.640
Who is it?

04:10.640 --> 04:12.640
Is it him?

04:12.640 --> 04:14.640
Why can't you tell me?

04:14.640 --> 04:16.640
Is it a lie?

04:16.640 --> 04:18.640
No.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.640
Don't lie to me. Let's go see Sunwoo.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.640
Why do you want to see Sunwoo?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.640
It's really important to you.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
I'm going to tell you everything.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.640
Don't lie to me.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.640
What?

04:30.640 --> 04:32.640
It's him.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.640
What?

04:34.640 --> 04:36.640
It's him.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.640
Why are you so vague?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.640
It's him.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.640
It's him.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.640
It's him?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.640
Do you call your girlfriend?

04:46.640 --> 04:48.640
It's him.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.640
It's him?

04:50.640 --> 04:52.640
His name is Lee.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.640
What?

04:54.640 --> 04:56.640
It's him.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.640
His name is Lee?

04:58.640 --> 05:00.640
It's him.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.640
It's him.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.640
It's him?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.640
What's his name?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.640
What?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.640
What?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.640
You said you were his girlfriend.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.640
What's his name?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.640
It's him.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.640
What?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.640
Why are you sitting separately?

05:20.640 --> 05:22.640
What?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.640
I'm going to fart.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.640
What?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.640
I'm going to fart and sit back down.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.640
I'm next to you.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.640
I have a friend next to me.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.640
friend?

05:34.640 --> 05:36.640
I'm here to introduce you to a friend.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.640
I can't fart in here.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.640
I have a bad stomach.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.640
I was going to fart.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.640
Don't lie to me.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.640
What?

05:46.640 --> 05:48.640
Come out to get married next month.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.640
I'm here.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.640
What?

05:52.640 --> 05:54.640
I think you're uncomfortable right now.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.640
What did you do?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.640
What did you do?

06:02.640 --> 06:04.640
We always play pranks.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.640
What are you doing with your teeth?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.640
Sit down.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.640
Sit down.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.640
Sit down.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.640
My girlfriend is shy.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.640
Sit down.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.640
I'll sit down for a second.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.640
Why are you putting on makeup?

06:28.640 --> 06:30.640
Wait a minute.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.640
I'm so scared.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.640
I'm always funny.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.640
What's your name?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.640
Lee Boon

06:40.640 --> 06:42.640
Where are you from?

06:42.640 --> 06:44.640
I'm from Orion.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.640
We met while playing pranks.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.640
Are you two in love?

06:52.640 --> 06:54.640
I'm shy.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.640
I can't say I love you.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.640
Are you two dating?

07:00.640 --> 07:02.640
Why are you laughing?

07:06.640 --> 07:08.640
Do I look handsome?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.640
What's wrong with you?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.640
Why are you so far away?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.640
You're praying.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.640
What do you like about him?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.640
He's handsome.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.640
I'll listen to you.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.640
He's sexy.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.640
Do you have a phobia?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.640
He told me he was sexy.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
You like him.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.640
You're far away.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.640
Thank you.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.640
What do you like about him?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.640
What do you like about him?

07:44.640 --> 07:46.640
He's funny.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.640
I like his face.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.640
How long have you been dating?

07:56.640 --> 07:58.640
10 years?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.640
Be quiet.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.640
How long have you been dating?

08:02.640 --> 08:04.640
I don't know.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.640
You can't speak well?

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
It's been a few years since I came to Korea.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.640
I lived abroad.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.640
I lived in Uganda.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.640
Uganda?

08:16.640 --> 08:18.640
Don't ask me that.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.640
I'm not good at Korean.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.640
What's your job?

08:24.640 --> 08:26.640
I'm a lawyer.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.640
I'm a farmer.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.640
You're a farmer?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.640
You're a farmer in Uganda?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.640
I'm a lawyer.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
You're a farmer in Uganda?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.640
Stop it.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.640
Get out of here.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.640
What are you going to do?

08:44.640 --> 08:46.640
I'll talk to you.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.640
What are you talking about?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.640
Tell your mom and dad to come here.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.640
What did you just say?

08:58.640 --> 09:00.640
What did you just say?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.640
What did you just say?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.640
Tell your mom and dad to come here.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.640
This is a Christian church.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.640
Tell your mom and dad to come here.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.640
Okay, get out of here.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.640
Can I sit down for a while?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.640
Why?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.640
You're pretty.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.640
Do you like him a lot?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.640
Do you like him a lot?

09:24.640 --> 09:26.640
Do you like him a lot?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.640
Are you sure you're dating him?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.640
How much do you like him?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.640
As much as my head hurts.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.640
As much as my head hurts.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.640
As much as my head hurts.
