<br>
[00:00.000 --> 00:03.400]  A few days later<br>
[00:07.680 --> 00:09.480]  Yes, hello?<br>
[00:09.480 --> 00:11.160]  Yes, director.<br>
[00:11.160 --> 00:13.120]  Oh, I'm Lim Junbin.<br>
[00:13.120 --> 00:15.080]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.<br>
[00:15.080 --> 00:22.840]  Could you tell my father about it?<br>
[00:22.840 --> 00:24.840]  No, it's not anything else.<br>
[00:24.840 --> 00:29.120]  As soon as I got into the company,<br>
[00:29.120 --> 00:37.360]  I don't want the staff to be behind me when I become the director.<br>
[00:37.360 --> 00:41.520]  And I don't want to inherit the company.<br>
[00:41.520 --> 00:45.040]  Please tell your father.<br>
[00:45.040 --> 00:48.720]  No, if you tell your father, he'll understand.<br>
[00:48.720 --> 00:51.000]  I beg you.<br>
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  Yes, yes.<br>
[00:59.640 --> 01:01.360]  Hello?<br>
[01:01.360 --> 01:02.560]  Hello?<br>
[01:02.560 --> 01:04.520]  What's this all of a sudden?<br>
[01:04.520 --> 01:05.080]  Why isn't it working?<br>
[01:05.080 --> 01:06.520]  Wait a minute.<br>
[01:06.520 --> 01:08.240]  I'll try the speaker phone.<br>
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.200]  Hello?<br>
[01:09.200 --> 01:10.080]  Hello?<br>
[01:10.080 --> 01:11.160]  It's not working all of a sudden.<br>
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.320]  I just called.<br>
[01:12.320 --> 01:13.280]  Why, why?<br>
[01:13.280 --> 01:14.400]  Where are you?<br>
[01:14.400 --> 01:16.240]  Oh, I'm just here. Why?<br>
[01:16.240 --> 01:17.240]  You didn't forget, did you?<br>
[01:17.240 --> 01:20.480]  I'm going to meet Kim Hee-yeon's daughter later.<br>
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.120]  Oh, I'm not going to go.<br>
[01:25.120 --> 01:26.120]  I'm not going to go.<br>
[01:26.120 --> 01:29.920]  Hurry up and go to the Silla Hotel Lounge in 30 minutes.<br>
[01:29.920 --> 01:34.160]  Can't you just go instead of me?<br>
[01:34.160 --> 01:37.600]  Why would I go instead of you?<br>
[01:37.600 --> 01:40.400]  I don't know why I have to go.<br>
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.760]  Hey, don't you know how helpful Kim Hee-yeon is to my father's business?<br>
[01:45.760 --> 01:48.320]  My father is my father.<br>
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.400]  I'm me.<br>
[01:49.400 --> 01:52.040]  And I'm not interested in business.<br>
[01:52.040 --> 01:55.640]  And I just have someone I love.<br>
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.560]  It's not up to you.<br>
[01:57.560 --> 01:59.520]  Go and meet her in 30 minutes.<br>
[01:59.520 --> 02:01.120]  Didn't you hear me?<br>
[02:01.120 --> 02:01.920]  Hurry up and find me and get married.<br>
[02:01.920 --> 02:03.400]  Didn't you hear me?<br>
[02:03.400 --> 02:05.320]  I'm with the person I love right now.<br>
[02:05.320 --> 02:07.200]  I'm with you right now.<br>
[02:07.200 --> 02:09.800]  You don't have anyone you love all of a sudden.<br>
[02:09.800 --> 02:11.160]  I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.<br>
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.560]  I have someone I love.<br>
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.320]  I don't want to get married because I don't want to.<br>
[02:14.320 --> 02:15.200]  That's what I know.<br>
[02:15.200 --> 02:17.520]  You're at the coffee shop you go to all the time, right?<br>
[02:17.520 --> 02:20.800]  No, it's not there. Don't think about coming.<br>
[02:20.800 --> 02:22.000]  I'm going to go now.<br>
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.160]  Wait there.<br>
[02:24.160 --> 02:25.920]  Hang up the phone.<br>
[02:25.920 --> 02:28.880]  I'm going crazy.<br>
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.960]  I think he's coming.<br>
[02:35.920 --> 02:37.920]  Oh, my God.<br>
[02:47.120 --> 02:49.120]  Why are you laughing so much?<br>
[02:49.120 --> 02:51.120]  Why are you laughing so much?<br>
[02:51.120 --> 02:53.120]  Why are you laughing so much?<br>
[02:53.120 --> 03:06.080]  Did I look like a child who doesn't have a job?<br>
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.600]  I'm a housewife's son.<br>
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.800]  I'm sorry, but...<br>
[03:12.800 --> 03:14.160]  I'm crying.<br>
[03:14.160 --> 03:16.880]  What?<br>
[03:16.880 --> 03:18.240]  Did something bad happen?<br>
[03:18.240 --> 03:19.440]  Did someone die?<br>
[03:19.440 --> 03:21.680]  No.<br>
[03:22.240 --> 03:24.240]  Did you go to the funeral?<br>
[03:24.240 --> 03:25.040]  Why?<br>
[03:25.040 --> 03:27.520]  Hang up the phone.<br>
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.520]  I have to go see Sunwoo.<br>
[03:31.520 --> 03:35.120]  Why?<br>
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.520]  You're lying to me that you have someone you love.<br>
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.480]  What's wrong with you?<br>
[03:42.480 --> 03:44.480]  I'm crying.<br>
[03:44.480 --> 03:46.800]  What's wrong with you?<br>
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.800]  Did something get on my face?<br>
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.640]  Where is it?<br>
[03:54.640 --> 03:56.640]  What?<br>
[03:56.640 --> 03:58.640]  Where is it?<br>
[03:58.640 --> 04:00.640]  Honey, do you want some more?<br>
[04:00.640 --> 04:02.640]  Is it him?<br>
[04:02.640 --> 04:04.640]  Is it him?<br>
[04:04.640 --> 04:06.640]  Who is it?<br>
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.640]  Who is it?<br>
[04:08.640 --> 04:10.640]  Who is it?<br>
[04:10.640 --> 04:12.640]  Is it him?<br>
[04:12.640 --> 04:14.640]  Why can't you tell me?<br>
[04:14.640 --> 04:16.640]  Is it a lie?<br>
[04:16.640 --> 04:18.640]  No.<br>
[04:18.640 --> 04:20.640]  Don't lie to me. Let's go see Sunwoo.<br>
[04:20.640 --> 04:22.640]  Why do you want to see Sunwoo?<br>
[04:22.640 --> 04:24.640]  It's really important to you.<br>
[04:24.640 --> 04:26.640]  I'm going to tell you everything.<br>
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.640]  Don't lie to me.<br>

[04:34.640 --> 04:36.640]  It's him.<br>
[04:36.640 --> 04:38.640]  Why are you so vague?<br>
[04:38.640 --> 04:40.640]  It's him.<br>
[04:40.640 --> 04:42.640]  It's him.<br>
[04:42.640 --> 04:44.640]  It's him?<br>
[04:44.640 --> 04:46.640]  Do you call your girlfriend?<br>

[05:12.640 --> 05:14.640]  What's his name?<br>
[05:14.640 --> 05:16.640]  It's him.<br>
[05:16.640 --> 05:18.640]  What?<br>
[05:18.640 --> 05:20.640]  Why are you sitting separately?<br>
[05:20.640 --> 05:22.640]  What?<br>
[05:22.640 --> 05:24.640]  I'm going to fart.<br>
[05:24.640 --> 05:26.640]  What?<br>
[05:26.640 --> 05:28.640]  I'm going to fart and sit back down.<br>
[05:28.640 --> 05:30.640]  I'm next to you.<br>

[05:36.640 --> 05:38.640]  I can't fart in here.<br>
[05:38.640 --> 05:40.640]  I have a bad stomach.<br>
[05:40.640 --> 05:42.640]  I was going to fart.<br>
[05:42.640 --> 05:44.640]  Don't lie to me.<br>

[05:58.640 --> 06:00.640]  What did you do?<br>
[06:00.640 --> 06:02.640]  What did you do?<br>
[06:02.640 --> 06:04.640]  We always play pranks.<br>

[06:28.640 --> 06:30.640]  Wait a minute.<br>
[06:30.640 --> 06:32.640]  I'm so scared.<br>
[06:34.640 --> 06:36.640]  I'm always funny.<br>

[06:48.640 --> 06:50.640]  Are you two in love?<br>
[06:52.640 --> 06:54.640]  I'm shy.<br>
[06:54.640 --> 06:56.640]  I can't say I love you.<br>
[06:56.640 --> 06:58.640]  Are you two dating?<br>
[07:00.640 --> 07:02.640]  Why are you laughing?<br>
[07:06.640 --> 07:08.640]  Do I look handsome?<br>
[07:08.640 --> 07:10.640]  What's wrong with you?<br>
[07:10.640 --> 07:12.640]  Why are you so far away?<br>
[07:14.640 --> 07:16.640]  You're praying.<br>
[07:16.640 --> 07:18.640]  What do you like about him?<br>
[07:18.640 --> 07:20.640]  He's handsome.<br>
[07:20.640 --> 07:22.640]  I'll listen to you.<br>
[07:22.640 --> 07:24.640]  He's sexy.<br>
[07:24.640 --> 07:26.640]  Do you have a phobia?<br>
[07:26.640 --> 07:28.640]  He told me he was sexy.<br>
[07:30.640 --> 07:32.640]  You like him.<br>
[07:32.640 --> 07:34.640]  You're far away.<br>
[07:34.640 --> 07:36.640]  Thank you.<br>

[08:02.640 --> 08:04.640]  I don't know.<br>
[08:04.640 --> 08:06.640]  You can't speak well?<br>
[08:06.640 --> 08:08.640]  It's been a few years since I came to Korea.<br>
[08:08.640 --> 08:10.640]  I lived abroad.<br>
[08:10.640 --> 08:12.640]  I lived in Uganda.<br>
[08:14.640 --> 08:16.640]  Uganda?<br>
[08:16.640 --> 08:18.640]  Don't ask me that.<br>
[08:18.640 --> 08:20.640]  I'm not good at Korean.<br>
[08:22.640 --> 08:24.640]  What's your job?<br>

[08:36.640 --> 08:38.640]  You're a farmer in Uganda?<br>
[08:38.640 --> 08:40.640]  Stop it.<br>
[08:40.640 --> 08:42.640]  Get out of here.<br>
[08:42.640 --> 08:44.640]  What are you going to do?<br>
[08:44.640 --> 08:46.640]  I'll talk to you.<br>
[08:46.640 --> 08:48.640]  What are you talking about?<br>
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.640]  Tell your mom and dad to come here.<br>

[09:06.640 --> 09:08.640]  Tell your mom and dad to come here.<br>
[09:08.640 --> 09:10.640]  Okay, get out of here.<br>
[09:10.640 --> 09:12.640]  Can I sit down for a while?<br>
[09:12.640 --> 09:14.640]  Why?<br>
[09:14.640 --> 09:16.640]  You're pretty.<br>
[09:18.640 --> 09:20.640]  Do you like him a lot?<br>
[09:20.640 --> 09:22.640]  Do you like him a lot?<br>
[09:24.640 --> 09:26.640]  Do you like him a lot?<br>
[09:28.640 --> 09:30.640]  Are you sure you're dating him?<br>
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.640]  How much do you like him?<br>
[09:36.640 --> 09:38.640]  As much as my head hurts.<br>
[09:38.640 --> 09:40.640]  As much as my head hurts.<br>
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.640]  As much as my head hurts.<br>
